# Physarum Polycephalum Inspired Algorithm(PPA)
The PPA is also known as the Physarum Solver.
This repository contains codes of the PPA_based_algorithms. 

We want to mantain a series of PPA based algorithms in the Github in the future, hoping to flourish the relevant researches.
We will clearly point out which algorithms contained are reproduced but not originally proposed by us and which are originally proposed by us.

## This repository currently contains the following algorithm(s):
* The reproduction of the **original PPA algorithm**. (Originally proposed by Atsushi Tero et al.([Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/327/5964/439)). We also refer to the article [An Improved Physarum polycephalum Algorithm for the Shortest Path Problem
](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/487069) when we created the codes.)
* The EDPPA, which is our new work of accelerating the OPPA. This work is still under review.
* To be continued...
