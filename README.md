## This repository currently contains the following algorithm(s):
* The reproduction of the **original PPA algorithm**. (Originally proposed by Atsushi Tero et al.([Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/327/5964/439)). We also refer to the article [An Improved Physarum polycephalum Algorithm for the Shortest Path Problem
](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/487069) when we created the codes.)
* To be continued...
